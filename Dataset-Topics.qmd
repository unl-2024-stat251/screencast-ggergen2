```{r}
age_gaps <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-02-14/age_gaps.csv')
```

Things you plan to investigate using this dataset:

- How have age gaps in movie relationships changed over time?
- Do directors with more than one movie tend to have similar age gapes?
- Are there certain actors/actresses that tend to play characters with large age gaps?

Stat 251 topics you plan to cover during the analysis:

1. Summarizing the data set
2. Add and subtract dates to confirm age gaps
3. Clean the data
4. Graph data
